## 3.3 Terms and Concepts

### 3.3.1 Kenmei

While browsing through Communote's source code you might stumble across the term "kenmei" for instance in names of classes, methods or fields. Kenmei, which is the [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese) of the Japanese word 件名 that can be translated with tag or subject, was Communote's internal code name. Therefore it can just be substituted with Communote.
